<h1>1.4. - 15/10/2020</h1>
 
<p>Whilst waiting on others getting up to speed with GitHub I decided to change my Git username to something I could use both personally and professionally. I then needed to run some command line on my terminal to ensure that my cloned repo matched the master on Git.

I also created a new folder and added a new HTML file for today's task. I had done this previously when working through the Internal fundamentals. 

In addition to the above I've also used a tiny amount of HMTL to add a header and a paragraph wrapper around this update.</p>
