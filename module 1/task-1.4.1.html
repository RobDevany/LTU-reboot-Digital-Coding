1.4. - 15/10/2020
 
Whilst waiting on others getting up to speed with GitHub I decided to change my Git username to something I could use both personally and professionally. I then needed to run some command line on my terminal to ensure that my cloned repo matched the master on Git.

I also created a new folder and added a new HTML file for today's task. I had done this previously when working through the Internal fundamentals.
