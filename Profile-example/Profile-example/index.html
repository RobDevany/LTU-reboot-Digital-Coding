            <h2>Introduction to me</h2>
            <p> So what to say about me. I'm neither a developer or much of a web builder but I signed up the [re]boot Digital Coding with LTU to gain a better understanding of development practices and to further appreciate some of the frustrations that my developer colleagues have.</p>
    
            <p>Professionally I am a Delivery Specialist for a Digital Consultancy (AND Digital) where I work with various organisations to delivery programmes of work, provide guidance, leadership and coaching in how to maximise project delivery efficiency. I use a variety of different methods and tools but primarily follow agile based methdology and focus on giving those around a productive and welcoming environment that encourages personal development. Personally, well I'll keep a bit of that to myself for my now but if you do reach out and make a connection then I'm sure I can share a bit more</p>
        </main>
        <aside>
            <p> By signing up to LTU's course I have been able to gain some exposure to common tools, structures and functionality that I'd not previously explored. It's also refreshing to be able to look at a webpage with a different eye now. Whilst the course has taught primarily HTML, CSS and Javascript the holistic approach taken by the lecturers has broaden my own knowledge on development practice in general.</p>
