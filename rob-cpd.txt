Reflection
 

// Your reflection goes here
 

In today's session I've been able to create a repo, clone a repo and successfully committed changes to it. I've also had an intro to Git/Guthub and had a quick demo on the advantages of using VSCode including installing an extension. 

On a personal note what has been interesting is seeing the relationship between the editor & git.

I'm typing some additional text to build the habit of addind a description every time I make a commit.
