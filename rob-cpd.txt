Reflection
 

    // Your reflection goes here
 

In today's session I've been able to create a repo, clone a repo and successfully committed changes to it. I've also had an intro to Git/Guthub and had a quick demo on the advantages of using VSCode including installing an extension. 

On a personal note what has been interesting is seeing the relationship between the editor & git.

I'm typing some additional text to build the habit of adding a description every time I make a commit.

Whilst waiting on others getting up to speed with GitHub I decided to change my Git username to something I could use both personally and professionally. I then needed to run some command line on my terminal to ensure that my cloned repo matched the master on Git.

I also created a new folder and added a new HTML file for today's task. I had done this previously when working through the Internet fundamentals.
