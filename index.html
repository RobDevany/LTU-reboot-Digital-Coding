<h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>During this module I learnt how to right some basic HTML including some text formatting using the strong and emphasised commoands </p>
  <p>I also learnt how to use paragraphs and some structure for the HTML pages that we'd been working on </p>
  <p> Following on from this I created a webpage and added a picture, lists and links all new stuff for me </p>
