      <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>During this module I learnt how to right some basic HTML including some text formatting using the strong and emphasised commoands </p>
        <p>I also learnt how to use paragraphs and some structure for the HTML pages that we'd been working on </p>
        <p> Following on from this I created a webpage and added a picture, lists and links all new stuff for me </p>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>Playing around with CSS and have been able to create a separate style sheet. Whilst Alex was troubleshootings with other students I also used some of the last sessions learnings and added a image from Pexels for..... you know .... fun!</p>
      <p>Feeling confident with added colour (color) to my webpage I also used the Hex Colour picker on Google to pick a truly horrendous colour and drop that into my css sheet just so I had a variation to get the same outcome.</p>


      <h2>CSS pt 2</h2>
        <div> 
          <p>Continuation from the last session where we looked more at CSS and the layout/structure of webpages including using DIV, SPAN and varying properties of text within a webpage. Granted the results were fugly but the principles were understood.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Examples of this in action would be <span id="span-example"> using something like this to change the text properties within the paragraph</span> but leaving the surround text with a common look</p>
              </div>

      <h2>Progressing to more advanced HTML and CSS</h2>
        <div> 
          <p>We've continued to work through tinkering with layouts, more advanced commands and CSS styling. I've been introduced to the box model and also learnt that just cutting and pasting code can often present some pretty bizarre errors.</p>
